                                If minimalism had its whisper era, 2025 is full
                                volume. This year, subtle solids are taking a back
                                seat while patterns—bold, bright, and often battling
                                for attention—are running the show. In
                                fashion, interiors, and even product packaging,
                                the rulebook has been rewritten: don’t coordinate,
                                clash. Pattern play is no longer about careful
                                matching or tasteful restraint—it’s about letting
                                your visual instincts run wild, layering contrasting
                                prints, and creating a sense of personality through
                                purposeful chaos.</p>
